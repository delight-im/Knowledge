# Law

 * Copyright protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. The idea itself may be protected through patents.

## Software

 * The case Oracle v. Google has been about copyright and patent claims, where Oracle argues that Google infringed by copying the Java API. In May 2012, a United States District Court decided that Google did not infringe. Judge William Haskell Alsup started learning Java solely for the purpose of getting a better understanding of the case. The Circuit Court then, however, reversed the decision in May 2014, finding that Google *did* infringe on Oracle's Java API. In October 2014, Google then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the copyright fight.
