# Gimp

 * If you have a pattern that you want to repeat, there is an easier way than copying it time and again: Go to `Filters`, then `Map` and choose `Tile`. Make sure the two scales are connected (i.e. the chain is connected) and switch to percentage unit. Enter multiples of `100` in one of the boxes and press `OK`.
 * If you have a texture that you want to turn into a tileable pattern, go to `Filters`, then `Map` and choose `Make seamless`.
