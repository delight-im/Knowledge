 * You don't need to use antibacterial soap at home. Normal soap is just as effective as antibacterial one (almost) and has no disadvantages.
 * Your vision does not worsen if you wear (incorrectly adjusted) glasses, but wrong glasses can cause headaches and visual fatigue.
 * Your vision does not worsen if you read with too little light, for example. But bad habits can cause headaches and visual fatigue.
 * Underarm hair does not cause you to sweat more, but it provides the bacteria with a bigger target, possibly resulting in stronger odor.
 * It's not fresh sweat that smells, but older sweat where the bacteria start to cause more and more odor.
 * If you have shingles (herpes zoster), see a doctor within 48-72 hours, who will usually give you aciclovir (and paracetamol).
