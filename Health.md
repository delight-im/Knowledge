 * You don't need to use antibacterial soap at home. Normal soap is just as effective as antibacterial one (almost) and has no disadvantages.
 * Your vision does not worsen if you wear (incorrectly adjusted) glasses, but wrong glasses can cause headaches and visual fatigue.
 * Your vision does not worsen if you read with too little light, for example. But bad habits can cause headaches and visual fatigue.
 * Underarm hair does not cause you to sweat more, but it provides the bacteria with a bigger target, possibly resulting in stronger odor.
 * It's not fresh sweat that smells, but older sweat where the bacteria start to cause more and more odor.
 * If you have shingles (herpes zoster), see a doctor within 48-72 hours, who will usually give you aciclovir (and paracetamol).
 * "Sensations (information delivered by organs like our eyes) can be distinct from perceptions (ideas about sensations formed by our brains)." (Jim Davies)
 * "Just as blind people do not sense the color black, we do not sense anything at all in place of our lack of sensations for magnetic fields [unlike geese/birds] or ultraviolet light. [...] When you look at the scene in front of you, it has a boundary. Your visual field extends to each side only so far. If you spread your arms, and draw your hands back until they are no longer visible, [...] [t]his space does not look black. It does not look white. It just isn't." (Jim Davies)
 * Exercising makes you emotionally resilient and reduces your risk of getting depression. This is due to raised levels of PGC-1alpha1, producing a substance that breaks down kynurenine.
 * There are two ways you can improve your endurance performance: Increasing your oxygen supply (VO2 max) or lowering the oxygen demand by your muscles (running economy). Supply more and demand less.
