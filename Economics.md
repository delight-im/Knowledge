# Economics

 * "We have an industrial society that is based on the use of machines and technology, which serve to economize on labor. It would be logical that we should have to work less because we can have all of our needs satisfied with a minimum amount of activity. But what takes place is just the opposite. Today we work much more than ever before." (Anselm Jappe)
 * "The great innovations of the past are *now* well understood as being very, very important. It's very obvious. In almost every case, they were not widely understood as such at the time. In fact, I would assert that they were often actually viewed as trivialities or jokes. I don't think it is a new phenomenon to be this dismissive about new technology." (Marc Andreessen)
 * "When Thomas Edison was first working on the telephone, the assumption of the use case was the idea that telegraph operators needed to be able to talk to each other. It was considered so implausible that you would have a system that would let any ordinary person pick up the telephone and talk to another person, like that was clearly implausible, that was clearly not going to happen." (Marc Andreessen)
 * "It's hard to remember, but the Internet was laughed at. It was heaped with scorn from 1993 to 1997/1998. In fact, those of you who were in the industry at that time will remember that the New York Times had a reporter on staff named Peter Lewis. I'm convinced he was hired by the editors to just write negative stories about the Internet. It was all he did. And it was always 'the Internet is never going to be a consumer medium, the Internet is not nearly as big as these people think, nobody is ever going to trust the Internet for e-commerce." (Marc Andreessen)
 * "The car was absolutely viewed as a triviality and a toy when it first emerged. In fact, J.P. Morgan himself refused to invest in Ford Motor Company, with the response that it's 'just a toy for rich people', which is in fact what it was at the time. If you had one of the first cars, you had to be a rich person, which means you also had to have a driver, unless you were a very advanced rich person. You also had to have a stoker with the early cars to keep the engine going, and then you also had to travel with a full-time mechanic cause the thing would break down every three miles. So there were a lot of reasons to doubt the importance of the car." (Marc Andreessen)
 * "We have a large computer rust belt, which nobody likes to talk about, but it is companies like Cisco, Dell, Hewlett Packard, Oracle, IBM, where I think the pattern will be to become commodities, no longer innovate, corresspondingly cut their labor force, and cut their profits in the decade ahead." (Peter Thiel)
 * "Twitter is instant public global messaging for free. If you think about the impact of that, if you go back into any previous era, the era of telegraphs, the era of telephones, the era of television, and you tell that instead of having the communication technologies you have at the time, I can give you instant public global messaging for free, they would have thought you delivered it straight from heaven, like its the most astonishing communications breakthrough they could have possibly imagined. And we actually have it, and it actually works." (Marc Andreessen)
