# Android

 * Before you sell your used phone or tablet, remember to remove the SD card and perform a factory reset under `Settings` - `Backup & reset`.
 * You don't really need antivirus software on your Android device. You are quite safe if you always pay attention to apps' permissions.
 * Just switch off your internet connection whenever you want an ad-free experience. Most ads (e.g. AdMob) won't show up then.
 * The most popular app stores in China include those from [Baidu](http://app.baidu.com/), [Taobao](http://app.taobao.com/), [Xiaomi](http://app.mi.com/) and [Tencent](http://android.myapp.com/).
