 * "A critical, independent and investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy. The press must be free from state interference. It must have the economic strength to stand up to the blandishments of government officials. It must have sufficient independence from vested interests to be bold and inquiring without fear or favour. It must enjoy the protection of the constitution, so that it can protect our rights as citizens." (Nelson Mandela)
 * "'Socialism' is no more an evil word than 'Christianity'. Socialism no more prescribed Joseph Stalin and his secret police and shuttered churches than Christianity prescribed the Spanish Inquisition. Christianity and socialism alike, in fact, prescribe a society dedicated to the proposition that all men, women, and children are created equal and shall not starve." (Kurt Vonnegut)
 * "The story of *meritocracy* -- a society that migrates wealth, status, and decision-making power into the hands of the most capable -- is seductive. Rich people love the idea of meritocracy, because the alternative is that their lion's share is unfair, the product of luck, or, worse, cheating. But many of meritocracy's losers love it, too. In the [disputed] words of John Steinbeck, 'Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.'" (Cory Doctorow)
 * "[Some] states are on the verge of reversing decades-old laws about homosexual relationships and marijuana use. If the old laws could have been perfectly enforced through surveillance, society would never have reached the point where the majority of citizens thought those things were okay. There has to be a period where they are still illegal yet increasingly tolerated, so that people can look around and say, 'You know, that wasn't so bad.' Yes, the process takes decades, but it's a process that can't happen without lawbreaking. [...] The perfect enforcement that comes with ubiquitous government surveillance chills this process. We need imperfect security -- systems that free people to try new things [...]. Freedoms we now take for granted were often at one time viewed as threatening or even criminal by the past power structure. Those changes might never have happened if the authorities had been able to achieve social control through surveillance. This is one of the main reasons all of us should care about [...] surveillance, even if we are not personally chilled by its existence. We suffer the effects because people around us will be less likely to proclaim new political or social ideas, or act out of the ordinary. If J. Edgar Hoover's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr. had been successful in silencing him, it would have affected far more people than King and his family." (Bruce Schneier)
 * "What is [...] damaging -- and [...] engaging, and thus lucrative for Facebook -- is all of us in our own virtual neighborhoods of our own making, liking opinions that tell us we're right instead of engaging with viewpoints that make us question our assumptions." (Ben Thompson)
 * "As Cass Sunstein and others have shown, people become more extreme when they're around others who share their beliefs. [...] [T]he internet makes it easy to settle in a virtual neighborhood with people who agree with you. Polarization is going to get a lot worse before it starts getting better." (Ezra Klein)
