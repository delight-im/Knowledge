# Computer networks

 * "NAT" stands for "Network Address Translation".
 * On a typical network, you have an IP address like 192.168.0.20, which is a private IP, not your public Internet IP address.
 * A NAT router performs intelligent address translations between private and public IP addresses.
 * IPv4 and its small address space was the reason NAT had to be invented.
