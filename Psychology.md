# Psychology

 * "The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind-the-scenes with everyone else's highlight reel." (Steven Furtick)
 * "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." (Upton Beall Sinclair)
 * "[H]appiness [is] the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males. In contrast, pride show[s] the reverse pattern; it [is] the most attractive male expression, and one of the least attractive in women." (Jessica L. Tracy and Alec T. Beall)

## Learning

 * "Instead of studying, a student goes to a movie the night before an exam. If he performs poorly, he can attribute his failure to a lack of studying rather than to a lack of ability or intelligence. On the other hand, if he does well on the exam, he may conclude that he has exceptional ability, because he was able to perform well without studying." (Edward Hirt)
 * "The kids who race ahead in the readers without much supervision get praised for being smart. What are they learning? They're learning that being smart is not about overcoming tough challenges. It's about *finding work easy*. When they get to college or graduate school and it starts being hard, they don't necessarily know how to deal with that." (Carol Dweck)
 * "[A] science survey class [...] consists almost entirely of the theories that turned out to be right -- not the folks who believed in the mythical 'N-rays', declared that human beings had forty-eight chromosomes, or saw imaginary canals on Mars. [...] The people who believed in them frequently come across as ludicrous yokels, even though many of them were distinguished scientists who made real contributions to their fields." (Megan McArdle)
 * The most important lesson kids should learn is "the ability to learn from their mistakes, to be knocked down and to pick themselves up -- the ability, in other words, to fail gracefully." (Megan McArdle)

## Motivation

 * "Work finally begins when the fear of doing nothing exceeds the fear of doing it badly." (Alain de Botton)

## Social psychology

 * Milgram experiment
   * One of the most famous social science experiments of all time
   * Showed that most people will obey an authority figure even if the authority gives orders that conflict with the subject's morals.
   * Milgram wanted to prove that Germans have a stronger willingness to obey to authorities. Being the child of two eastern-European Jews, survivor's guilt after the Holocaust was probably one part of Milgram's motivation.
   * Milgram's work followed the Asch conformity experiments (where participants make judgments about drawn lines) but Milgram wanted to turn it "into a more humanly significant experiment".
   * The subjects were ordered to to give allegedly painful electric shocks to other people, who were in fact actors.
   * First tried on Americans in New Haven, the experiment showed subjects to be far more obedient than expected, so Milgram knew the German comparison wouldn't matter anymore.
