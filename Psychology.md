 * "[H]appiness [is] the most attractive female emotion expression, and one of the least attractive in males. In contrast, pride show[s] the reverse pattern; it [is] the most attractive male expression, and one of the least attractive in women." (Jessica L. Tracy and Alec T. Beall)

## Social psychology

 * Milgram experiment
   * One of the most famous social science experiments of all time
   * Showed that most people will obey an authority figure even if the authority gives orders that conflict with the subject's morals.
   * Milgram wanted to prove that Germans have a stronger willingness to obey to authorities. Being the child of two eastern-European Jews, survivor's guilt after the Holocaust was probably one part of Milgram's motivation.
   * Milgram's work followed the Asch conformity experiments (where participants make judgments about drawn lines) but Milgram wanted to turn it "into a more humanly significant experiment".
   * The subjects were ordered to to give allegedly painful electric shocks to other people, who were in fact actors.
   * First tried on Americans in New Haven, the experiment showed subjects to be far more obedient than expected, so Milgram knew the German comparison wouldn't matter anymore.
