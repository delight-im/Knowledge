## Two-factor authentication (2FA)

### Clock out of sync causing two-factor authentication to fail

If you have enabled two-factor authentication and your local clock is out of sync, this might cause 2FA to fail -- even if it's just a minute. Two-factor authentication requires that your local time is always perfectly in sync, so try updating your local time from the network.
