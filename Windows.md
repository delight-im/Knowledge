# Windows

 * In most applications, you can copy things (files, text, images, etc.) with `Ctrl+C` and paste them somewhere else with `Ctrl+V`.
 * If you want to move things (files, text, images etc.) instead of copying them, use `Ctrl+X` and `Ctrl+V`.
 * Lots of applications allow you to undo things with `Ctrl+Z`.
 * The program that you view websites with is called `web browser`, or just `browser`.
 * Some good free web browers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari.
 * If you want to write simple texts without formatting and design, use Windows' Editor or WordPad instead of complex Microsoft Word etc.
 * You can take a photo of the full screen by pressing the `Print` button (screen capture). Afterwards, paste the image (`Ctrl+V`) somewhere.
 * For basic graphics editing, the free Paint.NET is very good. For more complex work, try the free Gimp or commercial Adobe Photoshop.
 * In order to pack and unpack collections of files or archives, use the free 7-Zip.
