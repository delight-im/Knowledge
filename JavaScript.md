# JavaScript

 * Initialize all variables at the beginning of a function, and list them in alphabetical order. Use only one `var` keyword and give an extra line to each variable.
 * Always use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=`.
 * When using `for ... in` loops, always filter the contents with `hasOwnProperty` first.
 * For anonymous functions, add a space between the `function` keyword and the parentheses.
