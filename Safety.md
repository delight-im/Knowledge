# Safety

 * Always use the rear hobs of your cooker and make the handles of your pots point to the rear as well if you have small children.
 * Never put out a grease fire by quenching it with water. Instead, extinguish it by choking it, i.e. cover it with a lid or blanket.
 * When serving warm dishes or beverages to small children, always check the temperature again by tasting the food.
 * Never leave the control for water temperature at 'hot'. The next person using the water may scald or burn themself.
 * Secure your water faucets with a thermostat that limits the maximum temperature to 50°C.
 * On New Year's Eve, never reignite unexploded fireworks but leave them untouched or render them harmless with water.
 * Never keep firecrackers in your (trouser) pockets. They may ignite due to the friction and cause serious burns.
 * Never use liquid fire accelerants such as ethanol. These evaporate heavily and cause highly explosive vapor. Instead, use solid barbecue lighters, e.g. cubes.
 * After the barbecue, let the fire and the glowing embers extinguish and cool down completely. During that period, don't leave the barbecue device unattended.
 * If you expect that you might need to extinguish a fire, have a bucket of sand or a fire blanket readily available.
 * For burns, the most important emergency aid is cooling down the burnt places with water (about 15°C) for 10 to 15 minutes.
