 * Never talk to potential acquirers of your company just for the sake of checking whether you'll receive an offer to good to refuse.
 * When receiving offers from potential acquirers, expect a reasonable valuation. Should they ever be surprising, they'll always be surprisingly low.
 * When you receive an offer for a potential acquisition, let the acquirer make the effort, which they will certainly do in case they're really serious.
 * A good salesman is never the one to come up with a price first. Try to be the one reacting to the price, not the one proposing it.
 * If you're in talks about selling your company and you must come up with a valuation, put it out confidently and high enough for bargaining.
 * Get a good lawyer.
 * Get a good accountant.
 * As the buyer of a company, you'll usually prefer an asset sale, whereas as a seller, you'll probably want a stock sale.
 * Sole proprietorships or partnerships cannot be sold as a stock sale, as there is no stock available.
 * When selling a company, always keep your business running and growing until it's really not your job anymore.
 * "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works." (John Gall)
 * Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.
 * "Sizing the market for a disruptor based on an incumbent's market is like sizing the car industry off how many horses there were in 1910." (Aaron Levie)
 * Don't compare your company to a family -- it's not a lifetime relationship and layoffs are part of the game. You shouldn't (and can't) trust in loyalty blindly.
 * Consider your company a professional sports teams: You have a mission and come together with other people to accomplish that mission. The composition of your team changes over time, but your solidarity is based on trust and mutual investment, which results in mutual benefit. All of you have to prioritize team success over individual glory and yet this is the best way to achieve individual success as well. You are going to bring together a disparate team and achieve a common goal -- despite the reality of personnel turnover. That's what all businesses should strive for. (Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, Chris Yeh)
 * The main driver of inequality is returns on capital that exceed the rate of economic growth. (Thomas Piketty)
 * "Design depends largely on constraints. [O]ne of the few effective keys to the design problem [is] the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible — his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints." (Charles Eames)
 * Project management triangle: Fast, cheap, and reliable — choose two. That's all you can get.
 * Incentivizing the right behaviors is incredibly important. Rewarding managers with bonuses if their features are part of a final product, for example, can lead to feature bloat. Don't do that.
 * "[W]hile manipulating people with incentives seems to work in the short run, it is a strategy that ultimately fails and even does lasting harm. [We should] question our reliance on a theory of motivation derived from laboratory animals." (Alfie Kohn)
 * "[T]he more we use artificial inducements to motivate people, the more they lose interest in what we're bribing them to do." (Alfie Kohn)
 * "Start with focusing on a small market and dominate that market first." (Peter Thiel)
 * "If you don't want to split shares evenly then perhaps you should not be co-founders." (Peter Thiel)
 * "I am [...] a fan of the two-person founding team, with one more on the business side and one more on the technical side." (Peter Thiel)
 * "We know well we haven't survived because our strategies are farsighted and brilliant, or because our execution is perfect, but because for 15 years we have persevered in our mission of 'making it easier to do business across the world', because we have insisted on a 'customer first' value system, because we have persisted in believing in the future, and because we have insisted that normal people can do extraordinary things." (Jack Ma on Alibaba)
