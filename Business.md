 * Never talk to potential acquirers of your company just for the sake of checking whether you'll receive an offer to good to refuse.
 * When receiving offers from potential acquirers, expect a reasonable valuation. Should they ever be surprising, they'll always be surprisingly low.
 * When you receive an offer for a potential acquisition, let the acquirer make the effort, which they will certainly do in case they're really serious.
 * A good salesman is never the one to come up with a price first. Try to be the one reacting to the price, not the one proposing it.
 * If you're in talks about selling your company and you must come up with a valuation, put it out confidently and high enough for bargaining.
 * Get a good lawyer.
 * Get a good accountant.
 * As the buyer of a company, you'll usually prefer an asset sale, whereas as a seller, you'll probably want a stock sale.
 * Sole proprietorships or partnerships cannot be sold as a stock sale, as there is no stock available.
 * When selling a company, always keep your business running and growing until it's really not your job anymore.
 * "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works." (John Gall)
 * Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.
 * "Sizing the market for a disruptor based on an incumbent's market is like sizing the car industry off how many horses there were in 1910." ( Aaron Levie)
