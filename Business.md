 * Never talk to potential acquirers of your company just for the sake of checking whether you'll receive an offer to good to refuse.
 * When receiving offers from potential acquirers, expect a reasonable valuation. Should they ever be surprising, they'll always be surprisingly low.
 * When you receive an offer for a potential acquisition, let the acquirer make the effort, which they will certainly do in case they're really serious.
 * A good salesman is never the one to come up with a price first. Try to be the one reacting to the price, not the one proposing it.
 * If you're in talks about selling your company and you must come up with a valuation, put it out confidently and high enough for bargaining.
 * Get a good lawyer.
 * Get a good accountant.
 * As the buyer of a company, you'll usually prefer an asset sale, whereas as a seller, you'll probably want a stock sale.
 * Sole proprietorships or partnerships cannot be sold as a stock sale, as there is no stock available.
 * When selling a company, always keep your business running and growing until it's really not your job anymore.
 * "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works." (John Gall)
 * Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.
 * "Sizing the market for a disruptor based on an incumbent's market is like sizing the car industry off how many horses there were in 1910." (Aaron Levie)
 * Don't compare your company to a family -- it's not a lifetime relationship and layoffs are part of the game. You shouldn't (and can't) trust in loyalty blindly.
 * Consider your company a professional sports teams: You have a mission and come together with other people to accomplish that mission. The composition of your team changes over time, but your solidarity is based on trust and mutual investment, which results in mutual benefit. All of you have to prioritize team success over individual glory and yet this is the best way to achieve individual success as well. You are going to bring together a disparate team and achieve a common goal -- despite the reality of personnel turnover. That's what all businesses should strive for. (Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha, Chris Yeh)
 * The main driver of inequality is returns on capital that exceed the rate of economic growth. (Thomas Piketty)
 * "Design depends largely on constraints. [O]ne of the few effective keys to the design problem [is] the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible — his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints." (Charles Eames)
 * Project management triangle: Fast, cheap, and reliable — choose two. That's all you can get.
 * "Focusing on the problem you want to solve will keep you from getting blinded by your enthusiasm for a single solution." (hatchery.io)

## Validating your business ideas (online)

Test whether there exists a certain problem and you have the solution that your target audience is willing to pay for. Don't ask your target audience what they want. *You* have to know what they might want and validate that idea.

Four simple steps (hatchery.io):

 1. Talk to your potential customers about the problem in an informal setting and ask: "I believe [target group] has a problem/need achieving [goal] because [problem/need]. By [solution] we will help them to [benefit]. We will offer the solution for [pricing]. Are you interested?"
 2. Put together a landing page for the product that does not even exist yet and advertise it online, e.g. via Google AdWords. Just see if people are interested and perhaps get some email addresses of people who want to be notified on product launch.
 3. Built a minimum viable product (MVP): Offer your audience the solution they expected in the most simple and basic form that is possible.
 4. Get valuable insights, talk to your audience again and again, and find product/market fit — or dismiss your idea.

 * Throughout the process, question hard whether the people you talk to are really representative of your target audience and whether they are willing and able to pay for it.
 * If you can't get anybody to give you an email address, then you'll never get them to give you any money.
