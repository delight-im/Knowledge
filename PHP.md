# PHP

 * Check email addresses for validity with `filter_var('john@example.org', FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)` which returns a boolean
 * Always use the prepared statements of `PDO` or `mysqli` on user input before putting it in database queries — or remember to escape *everything* manually with `mysql_real_escape_string(...)`, `intval(...)` or similar functions.
 * Popular PHP frameworks include Symfony, Laravel, Zend Framework and Yii. You should choose one of these — even if you like another one better — because there's more talent available for employers, more jobs for employees and generally better support by third parties.
