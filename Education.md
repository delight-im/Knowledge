# Education

 * "We are deeply concerned [...] of the very large number of dropouts by schoolchildren. This is a very disturbing situation, because the youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Try as much as possible to remain in school, because education is the most powerful weapon which we can use." (Nelson Mandela)
 * Don't try to have your children occupied at any time. Boredom is an important source of creativity.
 * Teach self control and discipline in as many positive ways as possible.
 * Don't try to remove any bit of struggle in your children's life. They need it to grow. When all their toys are always within their reach, why should they start to crawl?
 * "[Parents and teachers] often praise the ability, the talent, or the intelligence too much. The opposite of this is the good process praise. This is praise for the process the child engages in â€” their hard work, trying many strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their use of errors to learn, their improvement. [...] The more [you give] process praise, the more [do] kids ha[ve] a growth mindset and a desire for challenge [...]." (Carol Dweck)
