# Education

 * "We are deeply concerned [...] of the very large number of dropouts by schoolchildren. This is a very disturbing situation, because the youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. Try as much as possible to remain in school, because education is the most powerful weapon which we can use." (Nelson Mandela)
