 * "The familiar Ancient Greek and Roman statues were not the grey, stone figures we know today. They were actually painted in bright colours and inlaid with jewels." (James Robertson)
 * "Egyptian pyramids have [not] remained the way they were at the time of their construction. Actually, their outside was made of white limestone, which concealed the layer of bricks underneath." (Saarthak Jajoria)
