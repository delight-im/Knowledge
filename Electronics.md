# Electronics

 * While earlier (nickel-based) batteries improved from full draining, newer (lithium-ion based) batteries suffer from that.
 * Never let your lithium-ion fully drain. Try to have the battery level above 20% at any time, if possible.
 * In the past, an Ethernet crossover cable (twisted pairs) was necessary in order to connect computing devices (of the same type) directly. Today, Auto MDI-X detects the required connection type via autonegotiation.
 * Modern (photo)copiers (i.e. digital copiers) have hard disks. In order to copy documents, they scan them first, save them on the hard disk and then print them. In most cases, the copy on the hard disk is either permanent or can be easily recovered later.
 * When using a digital camera to take a photo of a digital screen (e.g. TV, computer), you'll usually see a moir√© pattern. This unwanted effect is caused by interactions between the pixel grids of the screen and the camera sensors.
 * Energy density in modern batteries increases by about five percent per year through incremental improvements from R&D.
 * The expression 'more than Moore' refers to the integration of more than just transistors on a chip. One is putting other components on the chips, e.g. analogue components and radio circuits, eclipsing in a system-on-a-chip (SoC).

## Screen resolutions

 * Changing a monitor's resolution from its "native" resolution to something else was fine with CRTs, but cannot reasonably be done with LCDs, where it would result in bad picure quality due to their fixed rasters.
 * UHD (or 4K) is only worth it if you have a *very* large TV screen (larger than most people would be comfortable with in their room), if you sit very close (which you usually do in a presentation room but not at home). Obviously, all components (video source, connections and TV screen) must support UHD.
 * At a distance of 10 cm, the maximum resolution that the human eye can perceive is between 876 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) and 2190 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity). Thus at the average reading distance of 30 cm, it's only 292 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) or 730 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity). So printing magazines at 300 dpi is good enough for most people. For computer monitors or TVs at home, divide 88 dpi/ppi (normal visual acuity) or 219 dpi/ppi (perfect visual acuity) by the distance in meters to get the maximum resolution you may actually perceive. Thus, in order to take the most of Full HD on a 50" screen, you'll need to sit 2 m away. For 4K resolution, you must move closer to 1 m or get a 100" screen instead.
