 * While earlier (nickel-based) batteries improved from full draining, newer (lithium-ion based) batteries suffer from that.
 * Never let your lithium-ion fully drain. Try to have the battery level above 20% at any time, if possible.
 * In the past, an Ethernet crossover cable (twisted pairs) was necessary in order to connect computing devices (of the same type) directly. Today, Auto MDI-X detects the required connection type via autonegotiation.
 * Modern (photo)copiers (i.e. digital copiers) have hard disks. In order to copy documents, they scan them first, save them on the hard disk and then print them. In most cases, the copy on the hard disk is either permanent or can be easily recovered later.
 * When using a digital camera to take a photo of a digital screen (e.g. TV, computer), you'll usually see a moiré pattern. This unwanted effect is caused by interactions between the pixel grids of the screen and the camera sensors.
