 * While earlier (nickel-based) batteries improved from full draining, newer (lithium-ion based) batteries suffer from that.
 * Never let your lithium-ion fully drain. Try to have the battery level above 20% at any time, if possible.
 * In the past, an Ethernet crossover cable (twisted pairs) was necessary in order to connect computing devices (of the same type) directly. Today, Auto MDI-X detects the required connection type via autonegotiation.
