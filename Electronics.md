 * While earlier (nickel-based) batteries improved from full draining, newer (lithium-ion based) batteries suffer from that.
 * Never let your lithium-ion fully drain. Try to have the battery level above 20% at any time, if possible.
 * In the past, an Ethernet crossover cable (twisted pairs) was necessary in order to connect computing devices (of the same type) directly. Today, Auto MDI-X detects the required connection type via autonegotiation.
 * Modern (photo)copiers (i.e. digital copiers) have hard disks. In order to copy documents, they scan them first, save them on the hard disk and then print them. In most cases, the copy on the hard disk is either permanent or can be easily recovered later.
 * When using a digital camera to take a photo of a digital screen (e.g. TV, computer), you'll usually see a moir√© pattern. This unwanted effect is caused by interactions between the pixel grids of the screen and the camera sensors.
 * Energy density in modern batteries increases by about five percent per year through incremental improvements from R&D.
 * UHD (or 4K) is only worth it if you have a *very* large TV screen (larger than most people would be comfortable with in their room), if you sit very close (which you usually do in a presentation room but not at home). Obviously, all components (video source, connections and TV screen) must support UHD.
 * The expression 'more than Moore' refers to the integration of more than just transistors on a chip. One is putting other components on the chips, e.g. analogue components and radio circuits, eclipsing in a system-on-a-chip (SoC).
