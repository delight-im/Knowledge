# Creativity

 * "The most important process underlying strokes of creative genius is cognitive disinhibition â€” the tendency to pay attention to things that normally should be ignored or filtered out by attention because they appear irrelevant." (Dean Keith Simonton)
 * "When Alexander Fleming noticed that a blue mold was killing off the bacteria culture in his petri dish, he could have just tossed the latter into the autoclave like any of his colleagues might have done. Instead, Fleming won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin, the antibacterial agent derived from the mold *Penicillium notatum*." (Dean Keith Simonton)
