# IT operations

 * When a mail client/server is submitting an email to be routed by a mail server, it should always use port `587` for submission.
 * Ansible, Puppet and Chef are configuration management tools which system administrators can use for IT automation. The tools allow for scripted, documented and replicatable servers. Ansible is the easiest to get started with while Chef is the hardest.
 * Email transfer is done by Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) such as Postfix. They use the SMTP protocol.
 * Email delivery is done by Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) such as Dovecot. They use the IMAP and POP3 protocols.
