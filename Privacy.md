# Privacy

 * "If I can read your newspaper from orbit, what is public? If I can tell where you are in your house by imaging through the wall, what is public?" (Dan Geer)
 * The digital age and the internet take away the natural right to be forgotten. You are no longer able to fully reinvent yourself.
 * Privacy-preserving contact discovery remains an unsolved problem in practice. You can't hash contact identifiers before transmitting them because the space of pre-hash identifiers is usually too small, especially for phone numbers. Furthermore, you can't salt the identifiers. One might use bloom filters but this does not work for large lists of possible contacts. (Moxie Marlinspike)
