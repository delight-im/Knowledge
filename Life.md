# Life

 * Surround yourself with smart and inspiring people, and if you're the smartest person in the room, maybe it's time to move on.
 * Don't promise when you're happy. Don't reply when you're angry. Don't decide when you're sad.
 * Nothing is worth more than your personal health. Live a healthy lifestyle, and go to annual check-ups if possible.
 * Get enough sleep every night. Sleep is really important to so many facets in life, be it regeneration, attentiveness or physical health.
 * Getting up 15-30 minutes earlier every morning is not that much, but the effect on your available time in the morning is great!
 * Don't waste any time on jealousy.
 * What other people think about you is none of your business.
 * Don't be afraid to ask someone if you're not sure, no matter what topic, what time or place.
 * Finish one project before you start another.
 * Smile often, even to complete strangers.
 * Apologize when you should.
 * Be curious. This is certainly more important than just being intelligent.
 * Either at work or in your freetime, do something that makes you proud.

 * A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor.
 * "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." (Maya Angelou)
 * "Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore." (André Gide)
 * "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." (Oscar Wilde)
 * "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent." (Eleanor Roosevelt)
 * "Be the change you want to see in the world." (Mahatma Gandhi)
 * Success is like being pregnant, everybody congratulates you, but nobody knows how many times you have been fucked.
 * "Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up." (Thomas Edison)

 * "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." (Laozi)
 * "Determination is really two separate things: resilience and drive. Resilience keeps you from being pushed backwards. Drive moves you forwards." (Jessica Livingston)
 * "[W]e see our future selves as strangers. Though we will inevitably share their fates, the people we will become in a decade, quarter century, or more, are unknown to us. This impedes our ability to make good choices on their — which of course is our own—behalf. [...] We might choose to procrastinate, and let some other version of our self deal with problems or chores. Or, as in the case of [a] smoking boy, we can focus on that version of our self that derives pleasure, and ignore the one that pays the price." (Alisa Opar)
 * "Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. [...] I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death." (Nelson Mandela)

Everyone unanimously agrees that we can't possibly go to McDonald's, and better lunch suggestions emerge. [...] It's as if we've broken the ice with the worst possible idea. [...] [P]eople are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones. [...] The second step is easier than the first." (Jon Bell)

 * "I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics ... then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do." (Steve Jobs)
 * "Before cofounding GitHub I applied for an engineering job at Yahoo and didn't get it. Don't let other people discourage you." (Chris Wanstrath)
 * Survivorship bias, a type of selection bias, is the error of concentrating on subjects that "survived" some process or selection and thereby overlooking all the others due to their lack of visibility.
 * If you believe that music in the past was better than today's music, it may be because only the most popular music from one generation "survives" and, in a form of survivorship bias, distorts the comparability for you.
 * In the area of highly competitive careers (e.g. with singers, movie stars and athletes), one does generally overlook the myriad of people that may have been similarly skilled and determined as the victorious ones, but who did ultimately fail because they were not as lucky. This causes a survivorship bias.

 * "We shouldn't be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas." (Noam Chomsky)
 * "[As an astronaut, you] develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, 'Look at that, you son of a bitch'." (Edgar D. Mitchell)
 * "Adulthood is emailing 'sorry for the delayed response!' back and forth until one of you dies." (Marissa Miller)
 * "Inherit (or luck into) a large fortune, and give a couple million to a good cause -- never mind that it will affect your quality of life not at all -- and you'll be lionized as a hero. The great and the good will invite you onto their podiums -- but a poor person who takes in a foster kid gets virtually no recognition, even if fostering involves real sacrifice on their part." (Cory Doctorow)
 * "Don't forget that most men with nothing would rather protect the possibility of becoming rich than face the reality of being poor." (John Dickinson ("1776"))
 * "Meritocracy is a tautology, of course. There's no objective measure of *merit* so there's no way to know whether your society is meritocratic or not. Every famous, powerful, rich person owes their status to a combination of skill, luck, and persistence. The best luck of all is to be born to fortunate circumstances, well fed and well educated and well loved. We know for a fact that billions lack some or all of these forms of luck, and among those people are innumerable potential Stephen Hawkings and Steve Jobses and Albert Einsteins. The fact that Jobs was born to a Syrian refugee and that Hawking struggles with a debilitating illness just shows you how fickle luck is -- unless you believe that evolution produced exactly one brilliant tech entrepreneur in the ranks of Syrian refugees and one brilliant scientist with ALS, then you have to believe that the others just didn't get quite so lucky." (Cory Doctorow)
