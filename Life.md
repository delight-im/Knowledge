# Life

 * Surround yourself with smart and inspiring people, and if you're the smartest person in the room, maybe it's time to move on.
 * Don't make promises in the moment you're happy and delighted.

 * Getting up 15-30 minutes earlier every morning is not that much, but the effect on your available time in the morning is great!

 * "[W]e see our future selves as strangers. Though we will inevitably share their fates, the people we will become in a decade, quarter century, or more, are unknown to us. This impedes our ability to make good choices on their — which of course is our own—behalf. [...] We might choose to procrastinate, and let some other version of our self deal with problems or chores. Or, as in the case of [a] smoking boy, we can focus on that version of our self that derives pleasure, and ignore the one that pays the price." (Alisa Opar)

[...] [P]eople are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones. [...] The second step is easier than the first." (Jon Bell)
