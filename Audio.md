# Audio

 * The human hearing range spans 20Hz to 20kHz. (Christopher Montgomery)
 * "[W]e can use low rate 44.1kHz or 48kHz audio with all the fidelity benefits of 192kHz or higher sampling (smooth frequency response, low aliasing) and none of the drawbacks (ultrasonics that cause intermodulation distortion, wasted space). Nearly all of today's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) oversample at very high rates." (Christopher Montgomery)
 * "[T]here are (and always will be) reasons to use more than 16 bits in recording and production. None of that is relevant to playback; here 24 bit audio is as useless as 192kHz sampling. The good news is that at least 24 bit depth doesn't harm fidelity. It just doesn't help, and also wastes space." (Christopher Montgomery)
 * "16 bits is enough to span the real hearing range with room to spare. It does not span the entire possible signal range of audio equipment." (Christopher Montgomery)
 * "Music is no longer an expression of the soul or the work of an artist; it's a 'product' that is manufactured, packaged, catalogued, distributed, managed, regulated, and above all *sold*." (Christopher Montgomery)
