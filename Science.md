 * "You have as much computing power in an Apple iPhone as was available at the time of the Apollo missions. But what is it being used for? It's being used to throw angry birds at pigs; it's being used to send pictures of your cat to people halfway around the world; it's being used to check in as the virtual mayor of a virtual nowhere while you're riding a subway from the nineteenth century." (Peter Thiel)
 * "Nixon's 1974 call for full energy independence by 1980 has given way to Obama's 2011 call for one-third oil independence by 2020." (Peter Thiel)
 * "The Golden Gate Bridge was built in three-and-a-half years in the 1930s. It's taken seven years to build an access road that costs more than the original bridge in real dollars." (Peter Thiel)
 * Deep water does not freeze as easily because (a) it takes colder temperatures to freeze water under pressure (b) existing ice will always float at the top and prevent exchange (c) there's geothermal energy from the ocean bed.
 * "Computing devices have been consistently multiplying in power [...] from the mechanical calculating devices used in the 1890 U.S. census, to Turing's relay-based machine that cracked the Nazi enigma code, to the vacuum tube computer that predicted Eisenhower's win in 1952, to the transistor-based machines used in the first space launches, to the integrated-circuit-based personal computer." (Ray Kurzweil)
 * "Moore's law" is the observation and forecast (and not a physical or natural law) by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore from 1965, revised in 1975, noticing that over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.
