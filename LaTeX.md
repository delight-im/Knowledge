# LaTeX

 * `\mathbb{...}` prints the enclosed text as "blackboard bold", i.e. how you would write bold letters if you had to do this on a blackboard. This can be used for uppercase letters only and usually results in vertical or near-vertical lines being doubled. On a typewriter, they would be *double-struck* with a small offset.
 * `\mathcal{...}` prints the enclosed text in calligraphic font, giving form to the text in an expressive manner.

## Mathematics

 * For number sets such as integers or natural numbers, use `\mathbb{...}`, e.g. `\mathbb{Z}` or `\mathbb{N}`.
 * Use `\mathcal{P}(...)` for the power set of a given set, e.g. `\mathcal{P}(X)`.
