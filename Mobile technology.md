# Mobile technology

 * Every feature phone, smartphone -- or even tablets with 3G, LTE, etc. -- has a baseband processor that runs proprietary, closed software. That software implements standards and uses code from the '80s and '90s. Thus it has weak security measures, is missing a lot of checks and often trusts data received from base stations blindly, resulting in the presence of many bugs and vulnerabilities -- over the air! It is often possible to enable auto-answer, turn on microphones or cameras, send SMS or execute arbitrary code. But this component of modern devices is not only poorly understood and really low-level, it does also require certification and is protected by lots of patents.
 * Would people want to put your app on their home screen? If yes, you should build a native app for the particular platform. If not, you should build a website. Most often, this is true when the customer needs occasional connections to the business, such as finding the opening hours. People will search for that information on the web, they don't want to install an app just to find that piece of information once.
