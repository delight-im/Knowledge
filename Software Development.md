# Software Development

 * Use a version control system like Git, Mercurial or Subversion to manage your source code, track changes and simplify collaboration.
 * When using a version control system, make a single commit for every bug fix or added feature. Do not hoard changes and commit them in batch.
 * Use an IDE that suits your programming language, e.g. IntelliJ IDEA (Java), PhpStorm (PHP), Eclipse (Android) or Android Studio (Android).
 * Commercial programming is solving problems you didn't choose, working on existing code you didn't write â€” in less time than you would like.
