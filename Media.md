 * The world's most famous photo is (arguably) "Guerrillero Heroico" by Alberto Korda from 1960, showing the then 31-year-old revolutionary Che Guevara. The photographer did not receive (or claim) any payments for his picture, which also helped the photo become so popular.
 * "A showrunner's duties often combine those traditionally assigned to the writer, executive producer and script editor. Unlike films, where directors are in creative control of a production, in episodic television, the showrunner outranks the director." (Wikipedia, various authors)
 * "The [music] record business as most people know it, was just a short hundred-year blip in the 40,000 year history of the music business. A stopgap to solve a temporary problem that existed between the invention of sound recording (1890's) and the invention of the internet (1990's). Few other art forms let artists get rich off *copies* of their art. [...] Early musicians didn't have that luxury. Mozart didn't sell one [...] copy. Taylor Swift sold 110 million. Not to mention other art forms. Painters wish they had an opportunity to get rich off copies." (Philip Kaplan)
