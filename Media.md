 * The world's most famous photo is (arguably) "Guerrillero Heroico" by Alberto Korda from 1960, showing the then 31-year-old revolutionary Che Guevara. The photographer did not receive (or claim) any payments for his picture, which also helped the photo become so popular.
 * "A showrunner's duties often combine those traditionally assigned to the writer, executive producer and script editor. Unlike films, where directors are in creative control of a production, in episodic television, the showrunner outranks the director." (Wikipedia, various authors)
 * While Spotify doesn't pay owners of recordings, publishers, songwriters and artists *per stream*, an effective "per stream" average can be calculated. It's between 5.00 USD and 8.00 USD per 1,000 streams.
 * "Rihanna is often described as a 'manufactured' pop star, because she doesn't write her songs, but neither did Sinatra or Elvis. She embodies a song in the way an actor inhabits a role -- and no one expects the actor to write the script." (John Seabrook)
 * Depending on the type of ads shown (e.g. pre-roll or banner ads), whether ads are paid for on a per-click (CPC) or per-view (CPM) basis, and depending on the audience (e.g. demographics and geographical origin), YouTube videos can, on average, generate between 0.80 USD and 5.00 USD of revenue per 1,000 views for users.
 * "The contention of Frantz Fanon, the 20th century revolutionary, [was] that 'the aim of terrorism is to terrify'. How do the media help do that? By hyping the threat from terrorism." (David R. Henderson)
 * "The current system of ad-supported news leads to clickbait and sensationalism. We need to pay for good journalism." (Andrew Ng)
