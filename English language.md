# English language

 * For nouns, you use the singular form only for the number `1` and the plural form otherwise. So it's `0 trains`, `5 trains`, `-1 trains`, but `1 train` or `no train`.
 * If you write a headline, you often capitalize everything except for articles, coordinate conjunctions (`and`, `or`), prepositions and `to`.
