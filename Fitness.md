 * Muscles don't grow during training, muscles grow in the rest time when your body recovers. Always rest 2-3 days after a hard workout.
 * In order to grow, muscles need a constant supply of protein, between 80g and 200g per day. Your body can't store reserves of protein.
 * In the morning, try to get as much carbohydrates as possible (for energy), and gradually reduce the amount over the course of the day.
 * In the evening, you should avoid carbohydrates as far as this is possible. Try to get more protein, instead.
 * Fat is not the only thing that lets you put on weight. Carbohydrates can be just as dangerous, if not even more dangerous.
 * Sugar is a poor form of carbohydrates and should be avoided whenever possible. It doesn't last long, and is of lower quality.
 * "I don't count my sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting, because then it really counts." (Muhammad Ali)
 * "I hated every minute of training, but I said: Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion." (Muhammad Ali)
 * "You can't control how lucky or smart you are, but you can control how hard you work, so that's the first thing." (Michael Bloomberg)
 * "If we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: Either you're giving up first, or I'm going to die. Simple, right?" (Will Smith)
 * "While it's true that exercising at light intensities uses fat as the dominant source of energy, the overall energy requirement is substantially smaller, so you are burning far fewer calories than you would be if you were exercising at higher intensity. So in terms of achieving weight loss, that's totally counter intuitive." (Chris Easton)
 * "One of the biggest health benefits of swimming is that it's non-weight bearing, which means you won't be putting any strain on muscles and joints. Sadly, that same effect might be your downfall if you want to swim to lose weight, because you aren't lifting your own body weight as you are with running, which makes for a comparatively easier workout. [...] [There] is another potential pitfall: swimming can stoke the appetite more than other forms of exercise." (Catherine de Lange)
