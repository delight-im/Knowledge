 * Muscles don't grow during training, muscles grow in the rest time when your body recovers. Always rest 2-3 days after a hard workout.
 * In order to grow, muscles need a constant supply of protein, between 80g and 200g per day. Your body can't store reserves of protein.
 * In the morning, try to get as much carbohydrates as possible (for energy), and gradually reduce the amount over the course of the day.
 * In the evening, you should avoid carbohydrates as far as this is possible. Try to get more protein, instead.
 * Fat is not the only thing that lets you put on weight. Carbohydrates can be just as dangerous, if not even more dangerous.
 * Sugar is a poor form of carbohydrates and should be avoided whenever possible. It doesn't last long, and is of lower quality.
 * "I don't count my sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting, because then it really counts." (Muhammad Ali)
 * "I hated every minute of training, but I said: Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion." (Muhammad Ali)
 * "You can't control how lucky or smart you are, but you can control how hard you work, so that's the first thing." (Michael Bloomberg)
 * "If we get on the treadmill together, there's two things: Either you're giving up first, or I'm going to die. Simple, right?" (Will Smith)
